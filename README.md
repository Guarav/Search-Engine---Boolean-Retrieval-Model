Search-Engine---Boolean-Retrieval-Model
=======================================

A simple Information retrieval engine which works on boolean queries in java

Notes :

->Main Class - Solr.main

->It calls the Tokeniser to create tokens of the query while querying and adding docs.

->This code handles only string as docs right now.

->Indexes are stored as indexes.ser file which is serialised object - old docs which were indexed can still be retrieved
